## Project Overview

This project contains a script to split a video into frames and a Go program to interact with it. Below, we provide an overview of the key components and how they work.

### Files and Directories

- **bubbles/**: Directory that likely contains output from the `split-video` script.
- **bubbles.mp4**: Video file used as input for the `split-video` script.
- **.git/**: Git repository metadata.
- **go.mod**: Module definition for the Go program.
- **go.sum**: Dependencies and version hashes for the Go program.
- **main.go**: Go program script.
- **split-video**: Script to split the video into frames.
- **tmp/**: Temporary storage directory.

### How to Use

1. **Splitting the video into frames**
   - Ensure that the video file (e.g., `bubbles.mp4`) is in the same directory.
   - Run the `split-video` script to split the video into individual frames.

2. **Interacting with the Go program**
   - Run the Go program (`main.go`) to interact with the split frames.

Further details on each component are provided below.
